title: About Me
---



Hi, I'm a graduate student at [Clemson University](https://clemson.edu), studying Computer Systems Architecture.
 
I graduated from [Institute of Technology and Management](http://ncuindia.edu) with a degree in Electronic and Communication Engineering. I made a small clone of a MIPS microprocessor as a part of my final year project.

I've got many diverse technical interests and I can program in C, [Python](http://python.org) and currently I'm learning to program in Java. My first job was at a web development company and hence I know [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and I've learnt [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) by myself.

Apart from my technical interests, I'm interested in travel, fitness and poetry. I'm especially fond of classic novels and poems.
