title: Hello World!
---

When you start to learn a computer programming language the first thing that every book teaches you is the obligatory *Hello World* program. I thought it would be good idea to begin the blog with a hello world post, but it's certainly not obligatory

### What I'll be talking about:

The blog will mostly be focussed on technical articles usually involving my research at Clemson University. I'll also try to share what I've learned by trying to customize various text editors like [Vim](http://vim.org), [Sublime Text](https://sublimetext.com) and currently my favorite [TextMate](https://macromates.com). 

Apart from all these technicalities, I'll sometimes throw in a non-technical post about my travels.


### What I'll not talk about:

I'll not discuss my views on politics, religion and other meta things here. All these are best left in the realm of oral discussion and not matters worth writing about. 


Cheers and I wish you all good health.
